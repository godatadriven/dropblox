        "You are given a `Field` object `field` with `field.height = field.width = 100`. Initially it is empty, but you can drop blocks in the field which will change the array `field.values`. To make it visual, simply print your field and view the result in a text editor.\n",
        "\n",
        "### > Blocks\n",
        "\n",
        "Blocks have a shape, a color and a unique ID. They are defined as instances of the class `Block`. The list of available blocks is defined as `blocks` in the provided notebook. Similar as with the field, we can visualize the blocks. The first block, `B = blocks[0]` with `B.block_id = 0`, looks like this:\n",

Blocks are dropped in the field *as is*, so they cannot be rotated. Also, a block can only be dropped once, but you don't have to use all of the provided blocks. \n",

        "This means: for every orange tile in our final field, we get +5 points. So just by dropping the orange block from above we would already get +30 points. \n",
        "\n",
        "With the multiplication factor, things can get crazy: if the *<ins>entire row</ins>* is filled with tiles of the *<ins> same color</ins>*, you get the values of those tiles multiplied by the corresponding factor. \n",
        "\n",
        "Lastly, you can get minus points. If a row contains at least one colored tile, all empty tiles in that row count as -1 towards your final score.\n",

        "12 4\n",
        "...\n",
        "```\n",
