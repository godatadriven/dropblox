# 🟨🟦🟥 DropBlox 🟩🟧🟪 

Welcome! I'm assuming you came here to give this coding challenge a try, great! After all, you could be the one to win the big price... So, let's get right to it! 

## Quickstart 🎬

You can either:

1. Open the Colab example

    [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NmfslkeZ4TWp-PZmq6XqWjoZhABoV82W?usp=sharing)

OR

2. Clone this repo

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/godatadriven/dropblox.git
    ```

    and open `quick_start.ipynb` ✓

## The rules 📜

### Points scheme
The task is simple: given a rectangular field and a set of predefined blocks, fill the field with the blocks and aim to get the highest score. 

How do you score high? That depends on the colors of the blocks you used, the rows you filled and the amount of empty cells in the final field.

### Submitting solutions
Don't worry, we took away most of the annoying work so you can focus on strategy. All you have to do is write a `.txt` file where each line specifies which block (by block ID) to drop in the field, and at which x-coordinate. 

> Check out the Quickstart example on how to generate the solutions file.

Submit your solution `.txt` at: https://dropblox.azurewebsites.net/submit
