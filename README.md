# DropBlox

Welcome! I'm assuming you came here to give this coding challenge a try, great! After all, you could be the one to win the big price... So, let's get right to it! 

First we will give you a bit more info about the challenge, but if you really can't wait, just jump straight to the "Quickstart" section.

## The challenge

The task is simple: given a rectangular field and a set of predefined blocks, fill the field with the blocks and aim to get the highest score. 

How do you score high? That depends on the colors of the blocks you used, the rows you filled and the amount of empty cells in the final field.

## Your solution

Don't worry, we took away most of the annoying work so you can focus on strategy. All you have to do is write a `.txt` file where each line specifies which block (by block ID) to drop in the field, and at which x-coordinate.
